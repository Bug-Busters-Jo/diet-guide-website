                    Body mass index (BMI) is a common tool for deciding whether a person has an appropriate body weight. It measures a person’s weight in relation to their height.

                <ul>
                    <li>A BMI of less than 18.5 means that a person is underweight.</li>

                    <li>A BMI of between 25 and 29.9 is overweight.

                    <li>A BMI over 30 indicates obesity.

                    <p> Female and male bodies store fatTrusted Source and distribute muscle massTrusted Source differently. Focus on the exercises that give you the most promising results for your body type.</p>
                    <h2>Pushups</h2>
                    <p>Pushups are simple and help build muscle in your arms and shoulders. To do a pushup:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lie face down on the ground.</li>
                        <li>Put your hands on the ground, palms flat, with your arms out at your sides and your hands shoulder-width apart.</li>
                        <li>Slowly push your body up until your arms are fully extended. Keep your back and legs straight so that your body makes a straight line.</li>
                        <li>Slowly lower yourself back down until your nose nearly touches the floor.</li>
                        <li>Repeat as many times as you feel comfortable.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="../image/1.gif" alt="">
                    <h2>Pullups</h2>
                    <p>
                        You’ll need some kind of pullup bar or sturdy cylindrical object to do pullups. Otherwise, this exercise is a simple way to build arm and shoulder muscles.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Grip the pullup bar with both hands. Your palms should face away from you. Keep your arms shoulder-width apart.</li>
                        <li>Pull yourself up enough to hang off the bar so that your feet aren’t touching the ground and your arms are straight.</li>
                        <li>Continue to pull yourself up until your chin is above the bar.</li>
                        <li>Slowly lower yourself down so that your arms are straight again.</li>
                        <li>Repeat as many times as you want.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="../image/2.gif" alt="">
                    <h2>Bench press </h2>
                    <p>
                        or this exercise, you’ll need a flat bench to lie on and a weighted bar. Don’t overload the bar, though, because you can injure yourself.

                        Bench presses help build shoulder, tricep, and chest muscles. This is a good exercise for bulking up. The more weight you can bench, the more muscle you’ll build.

                        You may want to perform this exercise with the help of a spotter for safety.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lie on your back on the bench. If the bench has a rack for the bar, face the bar. If there’s no rack, hold the bar carefully and slowly lie backward on the bench until you’re comfortable.</li>
                        <li>If there’s a rack, grab the bar with both hands, including your thumbs. Feel free to spread your fingers a bit.</li>
                        <li>Extend your arms to take the bar out of the rack.</li>
                        <li>Slowly lower your arms to bring the bar down to your chest.</li>
                        <li>Slowly straighten your arms and raise the bar back toward the rack. If there’s no rack, make sure you have the strength to sit back up after you’re done.</li>

                        <li>Repeat steps 4 and 5 as many times as you feel comfortable.</li>

                    </ol>
                    <img src="../image/3.gif" alt="">
                    <h2>Overhead press     </h2>
                    <p>You’ll need a weighted bar to perform this exercise. Overhead presses will help bulk up the muscles in your arms, shoulders, back, abs, and legs.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Grip the bar with your hands about shoulder-width apart.</li>
                        <li>Lift the bar up to just above the front of your chest, even with your shoulders.</li>
                        <li>Slowly lift the bar above you until your arms are straight. Keep your elbows locked and raise your shoulders like you’re shrugging.</li>
                        <li>Slowly lower the bar back to shoulder height.</li>
                        <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 as many times as comfortable.
                        </li>

                    <h2>What to eat to bulk up
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It’s not hard to gain weight by eating more. But be mindful of what you eat to gain healthy weight. A diet to bulk up mainly consists of healthy fats, proteins, and complex carbohydrates that help build muscle and use fat to burn energy.
                    </p>
                    <p>Try some of the following foods:  </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>lean proteins, such as chicken and fish</li>
                        <li>red meat with no growth hormones, such as grass-fed beef</li>
                        <li>eggs</li>
                        <li>full-fat dairy, such as whole milk and full-fat Greek yogurt</li>
                        <li>fat-rich fruits, such as avocados</li>
                        <li>nuts, such as almonds</li>
                        <li>whole-grain breads</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Take notes of what you eat in a journal or an app that tracks nutrients. It’s surprisingly hard to know exactly how much you eat unless you write it down. You may find that you aren’t consuming enough calories or that your food choices aren’t nutritious enough for a healthy diet.

                    <h3>here is some tips  for build muscle :</h3>
                 <h1>At-home workout routine
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Whether you’re a seasoned expert or new to strength training, working out at home is a great option when you can’t get to the gym or need a change of pace. <br>

                    The at-home workouts below require a limited amount of equipment. Plus, some of the movements can be substituted for bodyweight exercises in which you use your body’s own weight as resistance. <br>

                    These exercises can serve as a weeklong beginner’s routine or cycled to provide several sessions per week for advanced trainees.<br>

                    If your goal is weight loss, you can add a form of cardio, such as running or cycling, between sessions.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                   <b> Equipment required</b> flat-weight bench, appropriate adjustable dumbbells based on your level of experience.<br>

                        If you’re just starting out you may want to get expert advice at a specialty store to select the right equipment, but if you know what you’re looking for, you can also purchase adjustable dumbbells online.

                       <b>Rest intervals</b> : 60–90 seconds
